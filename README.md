# Galaxy Fighter 

![Game Screenshot](./assets/images/screenshot.png)

A fun little browser game where you move a rocket cursor around a spacey background, collect power-ups, and dodge obstacles. Made just for the vibes and to play with cool CSS/JS effects.

> **Note:** This game is currently not supported on mobile devices, since it's a cursor-based game. o.O

## How to Play
- Move your mouse (or finger on mobile) to control the rocket
- Grab power-ups, avoid baddies, rack up your score
- Try to beat your high score!

## To Play
Just open `https://rahu619.github.io/galaxy-fighter/` or clone the project and open `index.html` in your browser. That's it!

This is a casual, for-fun vibe-coded project. Enjoy! ðŸš€
